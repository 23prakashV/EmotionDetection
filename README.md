# EmotionDetection

DESCRIPTION

This algorithm utilizes a couple of key concepts to find what is the most efficient method to calculate emotions based on euclidian distances between the 68 facial landmarks. It utilizes these distances and neural networks to predict whether a person's face displays a happy, upset, surprised, or neutral emotion. The initial goal of the project was similar to a filter I had seen on social media, where your "smile score" (how much happiness is displayed on a person's face) is shown on a scale of 0 - 100 by 10 points. Ultimately, this goal was not met because the algorithm I wrote is trained on data that is preselectively one of the four previously listed emotions, and it is not trained by how much someone is smiling solely. I think this makes my project stronger and more diverse than I even wanted it to be.
